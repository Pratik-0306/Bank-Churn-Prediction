# Bank-Churn-Prediction
# Bank Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project aims to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) a bank using a Deep Learning model built with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on historical customer data and leverages Keras/TensorFlow to classify churn based on features like credit score, age, tenure, balance, and more.

## Project Highlights

- Built an ANN model using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Performed extensive data preprocessing: encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and balancing the dataset.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.
- Achieved [your model's performance, e.g., ~85% accuracy] on test data.
- Visualized performance using plots for learning curves and evaluation metrics.

## Tools & Tech Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The dataset is based on a simulated bank dataset commonly used in churn prediction problems, containing features like Customer ID, Gender, Geography, Age, Credit Score, Balance, and whether the customer has churned.

## Outcome

The model can help banks identify high-risk churn customers and take proactive retention actions. This solution has potential real-world applicability in customer relationship management (CRM) and financial analytics.
